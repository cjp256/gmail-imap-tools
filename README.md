# gmail-imap-tools

Tools to help you make the the most of GMAIL.

This started as a project to help me clean out millions of emails that have accrued over the years from being subscribed to various mailing lists...


## Tools configuration file

~/.config/gmail.cfg

```
username="<user@gmail.com>"
password="<imap-password>"
```

## GMAIL Configuration

To make the most of these tools, you will want to ensure that GMAIL is configured.

1. Enable IMAP:

https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop

2. Ensure labels are exposed to IMAP:

https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/labels
